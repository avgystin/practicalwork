# Tutorial: practicalwork

This project, `practicalwork`, functions as a _mock_ or _stub_ backend application, primarily showcasing fundamental web service capabilities like **order processing** and **session management**. It includes a valuable feature for simulating real-world network latency or processing times through _configurable delays_ for API responses. The application also leverages **Kafka messaging** for efficient, asynchronous event handling, and all critical data, such as orders and processed messages, is permanently stored using a robust _JPA/Hibernate_ **persistence layer** that interacts with a PostgreSQL database.
